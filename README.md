# Project Title

A non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace project is a platform that enables the buying, selling, and trading of NFTs. NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain, typically on Ethereum or another blockchain that supports smart contracts. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and have distinct properties that make them unique and irreplaceable.

An NFT marketplace serves as an online marketplace where creators and collectors can interact and transact with NFTs
